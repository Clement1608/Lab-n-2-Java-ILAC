# Lab-n-2-Java-ILAC

# Java Lab 2 – Full OOP Demo (Animals Project)

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java through an animal shelter simulation.  
It includes two main parts:

- Part 1 (package_1): Focuses on OOP foundations such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, ArrayList, and exception handling.  
- Part 2 (package_2): Focuses on interfaces, implementation, exception handling, and how two packages interact.

## How to Open and Run the Project

### Step 1 – Open the project
1. Open Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ, or any other Java IDE.  
2. Click on "File" → "Open Folder".  
3. Select the folder named **Lab2** (the one that contains the `src` folder).

### Step 2 – Explore the code
Inside the `src` folder, you will find two packages:
- `package_1` contains the animal classes and `FirstApp.java`.  
- `package_2` contains the interface, its implementation, and `SecondApp.java`.  

Each class includes comments explaining its purpose and logic.

### Step 3 – Run Part 1 (package_1)
1. Open the file `src/package_1/FirstApp.java`.  
2. Run the program (right-click → Run Java or use the Run button).  
3. The console will display a simple menu allowing you to:
   - Show all animals  
   - Choose an animal by its number  
   - View its information and sound (using polymorphism)  
   - Exit the program  

### Step 4 – Run Part 2 (package_2)
1. Open the file `src/package_2/SecondApp.java`.  
2. Run it the same way.  
3. This program demonstrates:
   - Adopting an animal  
   - Feeding an animal  
   - Viewing the adoption history  
   - Exiting the application
